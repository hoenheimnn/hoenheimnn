        I was born in Ecuador, I am 21 years old and I love music and arts, most
        of the time I spent my time in work and also in the things that I
        appreciate to spent my time, for example I use to play with my ukelele
        after my work and also learn some magic tricks to show all my family.

        I live with my family, mom and dad are awesome, and with my brother and
        sister, I'm in the Chruch since I have memory, but my parents are
        converts. After the had my brother, my dad found the Church with the
        missionaries, and after two weeks they got baptized, and the all family
        is now an eternal family.
